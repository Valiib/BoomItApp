# BoomItApp
Old game from my childhood.
## Game Description
You have 3 big squares that are inside each other and they are connected between each other.
You should make triplet to win the game.
#### Triplet
Triplet is when you have three connections on the board then you take your opponets pawn.
Its two player game and has very stric rules of playing.
#### Blockade
Bloackade is when your opponet cannot move so is a win for you if you are able to do that and is best win on the game according to me.
#### Developer side
Game is based on very strict algorithem that is optimized for best experience for players.
We have to check the game board in nearly every situation checking for triplets and for any other occurance you can start analyzing the code in Game Engine there is all writen
## What is missing at the moment 

## Game Design 
Design is very simple right only with colors and sqaures are not very defined I hope to met some designer to make it look cool!
### Game Info Board. 
I believe is very nessesory to make and game status board. Witch turn is right now is white or black or should I take or move or add another pawn.
